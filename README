Joint lets you do:

    class Doc
      include MongoMapper::Document
      plugin Joint

      attachment :image
    end

And stores everything in GridFS, but doesn't have any image processing

Paperclip lets you do:

    class Doc < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_attached_file :image, :styles => {:thumb => {:geometry => '50x50>'}, :large => {:geometry => '500x500>'}}
    end

But is attached to ActiveRecord and wants to work w/ a regular filesystem.

Roachclip lets you do:

    class Doc
      include MongoMapper::Document
      plugin Roachclip

      roachclip :image, :styles => {:thumb => {:geometry => '50x50>'}, :large => {:geometry => '500x500>'}}
    end

Which combines Joint's GridFS-ness with Paperclip's image processing-ness
